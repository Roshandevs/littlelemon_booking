# Little Lemon Booking Website

## Project Description
This project was developed as part of Meta's Front-End Development course on Coursera. It serves as the culmination of the Front-End Development Track and features a comprehensive booking application integrated into the Little Lemon website.

The application is built using React components, demonstrating a strong understanding of React for website development. Key functionalities include API calls to manage and retrieve data. Currently, the only fully functional feature is the "Reserve a Table" option.

This project showcases practical implementation of React for dynamic web applications and highlights proficiency in integrating API calls within a real-world context.
